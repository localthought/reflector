/**
 * Origin markers for reflected records.
 *
 * When Reflector copies a record from one system to another, the copy has to
 * carry a durable link back to the record it came from — so a later pass can
 * tell an original apart from a copy and never reflect a copy onward (which
 * would loop). Systems with a structured metadata channel (e.g. Google
 * Calendar's `extendedProperties.private`) can hold that link as a field; on
 * systems without one — notably **GitHub issues and comments** — the only
 * durable place is the body text itself, as an HTML comment that renders
 * invisibly.
 *
 * This module is that codec: {@link embedMarker} writes the hidden comment,
 * {@link parseMarker} reads it back, and {@link hasMarker} is the cheap
 * "is this already a copy?" check. It is deliberately free of any GitHub or
 * transport specifics — it operates on plain strings.
