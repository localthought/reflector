## Turn 1

**User prompt:** pointed at [localthought/reflector#37](https://github.com/localthought/reflector/issues/37), "Too many redirects" — the issue body only contained a screenshot and "Can you test this yourself with browser?".

**Assistant output (summarized):**

Fetched the linked screenshot (a Chrome `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` page) and read its address bar: the browser was stuck on the app's own
`reflector-prod-8e1e64ecb238.herokuapp.com/auth/login?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...` — i.e. looping on `/auth/login` itself rather than ever reaching Google's consent screen. Confirmed the live symptom directly with `curl -D -` against the production URL: the `/auth/login` handler's `Location` header was `?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&response_type=code&scope=&state=...` — a query-only, schemeless, hostless, pathless redirect target, which a browser resolves *relative to the current path*, sending it right back to `/auth/login` with a fresh `state` each time.

Traced this to `src/oauth/oauth.ts`'s `buildAuthUrl`, which prefixes the query string with `profile.authorizationUrl`. `profile` is `NO_AUTH_PROFILE` (all fields empty, defined in `src/main.ts`) whenever `deriveAuthProfile(document)` fails to find an `oauth2` `authorizationCode` security scheme in the configured OpenAPI document — logged only as a `console.warn` at boot, never surfaced to the browser. The empty `scope=` in the captured `Location` header matched `NO_AUTH_PROFILE.scopes` being `[]`, confirming this is exactly the profile in play on the production instance (most likely due to a document/overlay misconfiguration specific to that deployment, since `deriveAuthProfile` succeeds against this repo's own vendored spec + overlays when run locally).

The separate, fixable application bug: `createApp`'s `configured()` check in `src/server/app.ts` only verified `config.oauth.clientId`/`clientSecret` were set — it never checked whether the derived `AuthProfile` actually has a usable `authorizationUrl`/`tokenUrl`. So `/auth/login` proceeded to build a broken relative redirect instead of failing loudly. Fixed `configured()` to also require `profile.authorizationUrl && profile.tokenUrl`, and split the `/auth/login` 500 response into two distinct messages so an operator sees "no interactive OAuth flow in the document" versus "OAUTH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET not set" rather than a silent redirect loop in the browser. Added a regression test (`__tests__/unit/server/app.test.ts`) exercising both the healthy-profile redirect and the inert-profile 500 response.

Opened this work as [PR #38](https://github.com/localthought/reflector/pull/38) (created from the Claude Code UI on this branch).

## Turn 2

**User prompt:**

> remove the UI for connecting to google and connecting to remoteStorage, it should just say 'this reflector instance reflects between these two github issue trackers each 60 seconds'

**Assistant output (summarized):**

The production instance that hit issue #37 is, per the investigation in Turn 1, most likely running in the app's *reflection mode* (a two-endpoint background sync between GitHub issue trackers configured via `REFLECT_A_REPO`/`REFLECT_B_REPO`), not the interactive per-browser Google Calendar connect flow the frontend was built around — so the Connect-Google / remoteStorage UI is dead weight there and should never have been shown.

Rather than deleting the interactive connect flow outright (it's the documented, primary mode for a personal deployment with no `REFLECT_*` env vars set), made the frontend reflection-mode-aware: `src/server/app.ts`'s `/api/me` now includes a `reflection` field (`ReflectionService.status()`, or `null` outside reflection mode). `public/index.html` gained a `#reflection-view` section and a `#topbar-actions` wrapper around the per-user controls (storage picker, account, disconnect); `public/app.js`'s `render()` shows only the reflection card — with a message dynamically built from the real `systems`/`intervalMs`/`direction` (e.g. "This Reflector instance reflects between acme/repo-a and acme/repo-b every 60 seconds.") — and hides the Connect/App views and topbar controls whenever `reflection` is present, leaving the existing Google/remoteStorage UI completely untouched for non-reflection deployments.

Verified both branches end-to-end: built the app, booted it locally in reflection mode (fake `REFLECT_A_REPO`/`REFLECT_B_REPO` + tokens) and separately in plain interactive mode, and drove each with a headless Chromium (Playwright) to confirm the DOM — reflection mode shows only the reflection card with the correct generated sentence and hides the topbar controls/connect/app views; interactive mode is pixel-for-pixel unchanged. Added `__tests__/unit/server/app.test.ts` cases asserting `/api/me`'s `reflection` field is populated from a stub `ReflectionService` and is `null` otherwise. Full unit suite, lint, and prettier all pass.
